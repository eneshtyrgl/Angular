# Angular Services and Dependency Injection

## Importance of Services
Services in Angular play a crucial role in sharing data and logic across multiple components. They help in:
- Keeping components lean and focused on the view.
- Promoting code reusability and maintainability.
- Facilitating the separation of concerns by handling business logic outside of components.

## Dependency Injection
Angular's dependency injection system allows you to inject services into components and other services. This system:
- Promotes reusability by allowing the same service instance to be shared across multiple components.
- Enhances testability by making it easier to mock dependencies during unit testing.
- Simplifies the management of service instances and their lifecycles.
